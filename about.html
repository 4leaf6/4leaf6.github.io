      <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>This is a catalogue of Guilherme Feitosa's home production.<br>
      Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, sailed the world in search of a meaningul life. I ended up doing computer stuff by chance and now I am very fond of it.<br>
      Computers and technology were always present in my life since my humble childhood, but I hesitated for many years to go for my own vocation.<br>
      What finally brought me here? To accept who I am, and what I was born for.<br><br>
      My interests are: Games, Apps, OS, Cyber Security.<br><br></div>
